# Troubleshooting Azure Cosmos DB Performance

In this lab, you will use the .NET SDK to tune Azure Cosmos DB requests to optimize the performance and cost of your application.

## Setup

> Before you start this lab, you will need to create an Azure Cosmos DB database and container that you will use throughout the lab.

### Create Azure Cosmos DB Database and Containers

*You will now create a database and containers within your Azure Cosmos DB account.*

1. On the left side of the portal, click the **Resource groups** link.

    ![Resource groups](../media/05-resource_groups.jpg)

1. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **cosmosgroup-lab** *Resource Group*.

1. In the **cosmosgroup-lab** blade, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you recently created.

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Overview** link on the left side of the blade.

1. At the top of the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, click the **Add Container** button.

1. In the **Add Container** popup, perform the following actions:

    1. In the **Database id** field, select the **Create new** option and enter the value **FinancialDatabase**.

    1. Ensure the **Provision database throughput** option is not selected.

    1. In the **Container id** field, enter the value **TransactionCollection**.

    1. In the **Partition key** field, enter the value ``/costCenter``.

    1. In the **Throughput** field, enter the value ``10000``.

    1. Click the **OK** button.

1. Wait for the creation of the new **database** and **container** to finish before moving on.

1. At the top of the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, click the **Add Container** button.

1. In the **Add Container** popup, perform the following actions:

    1. In the **Database id** field, select the **Existing database** option and then enter the value **FinancialDatabase**.

    1. In the **Container id** field, enter the value **PeopleCollection**.

    1. In the **Partition key** field, enter the value ``/accountHolder/lastName``.

    1. In the **Throughput** field, enter the value ``400``.

    1. Click the **OK** button.

1. Wait for the creation of the new **database** and **container** to finish before moving on with this lab.

### Retrieve Account Credentials

*The Data Migration Tool and .NET SDKs both require credentials to connect to your Azure Cosmos DB account. You will collect and store these credentials for use throughout the lab.*

1. On the left side of the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate the **Settings** section and click the **Keys** link.

    ![Keys pane](../media/05-keys_pane.jpg)

1. In the **Keys** pane, record the values in the **CONNECTION STRING**, **URI** and **PRIMARY KEY** fields. You will use these values later in this lab.

    ![Credentials](../media/05-keys.jpg)

### Create a .NET Core Project

1. On your local machine, create a new folder that will be used to contain the content of your .NET Core project.

1. In the new folder, right-click the folder and select the **Open with Code** menu option.

    ![Open with Visual Studio Code](../media/05-open_with_code.jpg)

    > Alternatively, you can run a command prompt in your current directory and execute the ``code .`` command.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window that appears, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Command Prompt** menu option.

    ![Open in Command Prompt](../media/05-open_command_prompt.jpg)

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet new console --output .
    ```

    > This command will create a new .NET Core 2.2 project. The project will be a **console** project and the project will be created in the current directly since you used the ``--output .`` option.

1. Visual Studio Code will most likely prompt you to install various extensions related to **.NET Core** or **Azure Cosmos DB** development. None of these extensions are required to complete the labs.

1. Observe the **Program.cs** and **[folder name].csproj** files created by the .NET Core CLI.

    ![Project files](../media/05-project_files.jpg)

1. Double-click the **[folder name].csproj** link in the **Explorer** pane to open the file in the editor.

1. Delete and replace the content of your **.csproj** file with the following XML and then save the file:

    ```xml
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
        <PropertyGroup>
            <LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>
        </PropertyGroup>
        <PropertyGroup>
            <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
            <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework>
        </PropertyGroup>
        <ItemGroup>
            <PackageReference Include="Bogus" Version="22.0.8" />
            <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos" Version="3.0.0.17-preview" />
        </ItemGroup>
    </Project>
    ```

1. In the terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet restore
    ```

    > This command will restore all packages specified as dependencies in the project.

1. In the terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet build
    ```

    > This command will build the project.

1. Click the **ðŸ—™** symbol to close the terminal pane.

1. Double-click the **Program.cs** link in the **Explorer** pane to open the file in the editor.

    ![Open editor](../media/05-program_editor.jpg)

### Add Lab Starting Code

1. Within the **Program.cs** editor tab, delete the existing content and replace with the following code:

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
    using System.Diagnostics;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Bogus;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;

    public class Program
    {
        private static readonly string _endpointUri = "";
        private static readonly string _primaryKey = "";
        private static readonly string _databaseId = "FinancialDatabase";
        private static readonly string _peopleCollectionId = "PeopleCollection";
        private static readonly string _transactionCollectionId = "TransactionCollection";

        public static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            using (CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(_endpointUri, _primaryKey))
            {
                var database = client.GetDatabase(_databaseId);
                var peopleContainer = database.GetContainer(_peopleCollectionId);
                var transactionContainer = database.GetContainer(_transactionCollectionId);

            }
        }
    }

    public class Member
    {
        public string id { get; set; } = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        public Person accountHolder { get; set; }
        public Family relatives { get; set; }
    }

    public class Family
    {
        public Person spouse { get; set; }
        public IEnumerable<Person> children { get; set; }
    }

    public class Transaction
    {
        public string id { get; set; }
        public double amount { get; set; }
        public bool processed { get; set; }
        public string paidBy { get; set; }
        public string costCenter { get; set; }
    }
    ```

1. For the ``_endpointUri`` variable, replace the placeholder value with the **URI** value from your Azure Cosmos DB account that you recorded earlier in this lab: 

    > For example, if your **uri** is ``https://cosmosacct.documents.azure.com:443/``, your new variable assignment will look like this: ``private static readonly string _endpointUri = "https://cosmosacct.documents.azure.com:443/";``.

1. For the ``_primaryKey`` variable, replace the placeholder value with the **PRIMARY KEY** value from your Azure Cosmos DB account that you recorded earlier in this lab: 

    > For example, if your **primary key** is ``NAye14XRGsHFbhpOVUWB7CMG2MOTAigdei5eNjxHNHup7oaBbXyVYSLW2lkPGeKRlZrCkgMdFpCEnOjlHpz94g==``, your new variable assignment will look like this: ``private static readonly string _primaryKey = "NAye14XRGsHFbhpOVUWB7CMG2MOTAigdei5eNjxHNHup7oaBbXyVYSLW2lkPGeKRlZrCkgMdFpCEnOjlHpz94g==";``.
    
    > We will now execute build the application to make sure our code compiles successfully.

1. Save all of your open editor tabs.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Command Prompt** menu option.

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet build
    ```

    > This command will build the console project.

## Examining Response Headers

*Azure Cosmos DB returns various response headers that can give you more metadata about your request and what operations occured on the server-side. The .NET SDK exposes many of these headers to you as properties of the ``ResourceResponse<>`` class.*

### Observe RU Charge for Large Item

1. Locate the using block within the **Main** method:

    ```csharp
    using (CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(_endpointUri, _primaryKey))
    {                        
    }
    ```
    
1. After the last line of code in the using block, add a new line of code to create a new object and store it in a variable named **member**:

    ```csharp
    object member = new Member { accountHolder = new Bogus.Person() };
    ```

    > The **Bogus** library has a special helper class (``Bogus.Person``) that will generate a fictional person with randomized properties. Here's an example of a fictional person JSON document:
    
    ```js
    {
        "Gender": 1,
        "FirstName": "Rosalie",
        "LastName": "Dach",
        "FullName": "Rosalie Dach",
        "UserName": "Rosalie_Dach",
        "Avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/mastermindesign/128.jpg",
        "Email": "Rosalie27@gmail.com",
        "DateOfBirth": "1962-02-22T21:48:51.9514906-05:00",
        "Address": {
            "Street": "79569 Wilton Trail",
            "Suite": "Suite 183",
            "City": "Caramouth",
            "ZipCode": "85941-7829",
            "Geo": {
                "Lat": -62.1607,
                "Lng": -123.9278
            }
        },
        "Phone": "303.318.0433 x5168",
        "Website": "gerhard.com",
        "Company": {
            "Name": "Mertz - Gibson",
            "CatchPhrase": "Focused even-keeled policy",
            "Bs": "architect mission-critical markets"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Add a new line of code to invoke the **CreateItemAsync** method of the **CosmosContainer** instance using the **member** variable as a parameter:

    ```csharp
    ItemResponse<object> response = await peopleContainer.CreateItemAsync(member);
    ```
1. After the last line of code in the using block, add a new line of code to print out the value of the **RequestCharge** property of the **ItemResponse<>** instance:

    ```csharp
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"{response.RequestCharge} RUs");
    ```

1. Your **Main** method should now look like this:

    ```csharp
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        using (CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(_endpointUri, _primaryKey))
        {
            var database = client.GetDatabase(_databaseId);
            var peopleContainer = database.GetContainer(_peopleCollectionId);
            var transactionContainer = database.GetContainer(_transactionCollectionId);
            object member = new Member { id = "example.document", accountHolder = new Bogus.Person() };
            ItemResponse<object> response = await peopleContainer.CreateItemAsync(member);
            await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"{response.RequestCharge} RUs");
        }
    }
    ```

1. Save all of your open editor tabs.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Command Prompt** menu option.

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

    > This command will build and execute the console project.

1. Observe the results of the console project.

    > You should see the document creation operation use approximately 10 RUs.

1. Click the **ðŸ—™** symbol to close the terminal pane.

1. Return to the **Azure Portal** (<http://portal.azure.com>).

1. On the left side of the portal, click the **Resource groups** link.

1. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **cosmosgroup-lab** *Resource Group*.

1. In the **cosmosgroup-lab** blade, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you recently created.

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Data Explorer** link on the left side of the blade.

1. In the **Data Explorer** section, expand the **FinancialDatabase** database node and then select the **PeopleCollection** node.

1. Click the **New SQL Query** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the query tab, replace the contents of the *query editor* with the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT TOP 2 * FROM coll ORDER BY coll._ts DESC
    ```

    > This query will return the latest two items added to your container.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. 

1. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

1. Return to the currently open **Visual Studio Code** editor containing your .NET Core project.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, double-click the **Program.cs** file to open an editor tab for the file.

1. To view the RU charge for inserting a very large document, we will use the **Bogus** library to create a fictional family on our Member object. To create a fictional family, we will generate a spouse and an array of 4 fictional children:

    ```js
    {
        "accountHolder":  { ... }, 
        "relatives": {
            "spouse": { ... }, 
            "children": [
                { ... }, 
                { ... }, 
                { ... }, 
                { ... }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

    Each property will have a **Bogus**-generated fictional person. This should create a large JSON document that we can use to observe RU charges.

1. Within the **Program.cs** editor tab, locate the **Main** method.

1. Within the **Main** method, locate the following line of code: 

    ```csharp
    object member = new Member { accountHolder = new Bogus.Person() };
    ```

    Replace that line of code with the following code:

    ```csharp
    object member = new Member
    {
        accountHolder = new Bogus.Person(),
        relatives = new Family
        {
            spouse = new Bogus.Person(),
            children = Enumerable.Range(0, 4).Select(r => new Bogus.Person())
        }
    };
    ```

    > This new block of code will create the large JSON object discussed above.

1. Save all of your open editor tabs.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Command Prompt** menu option.

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

    > This command will build and execute the console project.

1. Observe the results of the console project.

    > You should see this new operation require far more RUs than the simple JSON document.

1. Click the **ðŸ—™** symbol to close the terminal pane.

1. Return to the **Azure Portal** (<http://portal.azure.com>).

1. On the left side of the portal, click the **Resource groups** link.

1. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **cosmosgroup-lab** *Resource Group*.

1. In the **cosmosgroup-lab** blade, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you recently created.

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Data Explorer** link on the left side of the blade.

1. In the **Data Explorer** section, expand the **FinancialDatabase** database node and then select the **PeopleCollection** node.

1. Click the **New SQL Query** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the query tab, replace the contents of the *query editor* with the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM coll WHERE IS_DEFINED(coll.relatives)
    ```

    > This query will return the only item in your container with a property named **Children**.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. 

1. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

### Tune Index Policy

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Data Explorer** link on the left side of the blade.

1. In the **Data Explorer** section, expand the **FinancialDatabase** database node, expand the **PeopleCollection** node, and then select the **Scale & Settings** option.

1. In the **Settings** section, locate the **Indexing Policy** field and observe the current default indexing policy:

    ```js
    {
        "indexingMode": "consistent",
        "automatic": true,
        "includedPaths": [
            {
                "path": "/*",
                "indexes": [
                    {
                        "kind": "Range",
                        "dataType": "Number",
                        "precision": -1
                    },
                    {
                        "kind": "Range",
                        "dataType": "String",
                        "precision": -1
                    },
                    {
                        "kind": "Spatial",
                        "dataType": "Point"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "excludedPaths": [
            {
                "path":"/\"_etag\"/?"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    > This policy will index all paths in your JSON document. This policy implements maximum percision (-1) for both numbers (max 8) and strings (max 100) paths. This policy will also index spatial data.

1. Replace the indexing policy with a new policy that removes the ``/relatives/*`` path from the index:

    ```js
    {
        "indexingMode": "consistent",
        "automatic": true,
        "includedPaths": [
            {
                "path":"/*",
                "indexes":[
                    {
                        "kind": "Range",
                        "dataType": "String",
                        "precision": -1
                    },
                    {
                        "kind": "Range",
                        "dataType": "Number",
                        "precision": -1
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "excludedPaths": [
            {
                "path":"/\"_etag\"/?"
            },
            {
                "path":"/relatives/*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    > This new policy will exclude the ``/relatives/*`` path from indexing effectively removing the **Children** property of your large JSON document from the index.

1. Click the **Save** button at the top of the section to persist your new indexing policy and "kick off" a transformation of the container's index.

1. Click the **New SQL Query** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the query tab, replace the contents of the *query editor* with the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM coll WHERE IS_DEFINED(coll.relatives)
    ```

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. 

    > You will see immediately that you can still determine if the **/relatives** path is defined.

1. In the query tab, replace the contents of the *query editor* with the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM coll WHERE IS_DEFINED(coll.relatives) ORDER BY coll.relatives.Spouse.FirstName
    ```

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. 

    > This query will fail immediately since this property is not indexed. Keep in mind when defining indexes that only indexed properties can be used in query conditions. 

1. Return to the currently open **Visual Studio Code** editor containing your .NET Core project.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Command Prompt** menu option.

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

    > This command will build and execute the console project.

1. Observe the results of the console project.

    > You should see a difference in the number of RUs required to create this item. This is due to the indexer skipping the paths you excluded.

1. Click the **ðŸ—™** symbol to close the terminal pane.

## Troubleshooting Requests

*First, you will use the .NET SDK to issue request beyond the assigned capacity for a container. Request unit consumption is evaluated at a per-second rate. For applications that exceed the provisioned request unit rate, requests are rate-limited until the rate drops below the provisioned throughput level. When a request is rate-limited, the server preemptively ends the request with an HTTP status code of ``429 RequestRateTooLargeException`` and returns the ``x-ms-retry-after-ms`` header. The header indicates the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client must wait before retrying the request. You will observe the rate-limiting of your requests in an example application.*

### Reducing R/U Throughput for a Container

1. Return to the **Azure Portal** (<http://portal.azure.com>).

1. On the left side of the portal, click the **Resource groups** link.

1. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **cosmosgroup-lab** *Resource Group*.

1. In the **cosmosgroup-lab** blade, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you recently created.

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Data Explorer** link on the left side of the blade.

1. In the **Data Explorer** section, expand the **FinancialDatabase** database node, expand the **TransactionCollection** node, and then select the **Scale & Settings** option.

1. In the **Settings** section, locate the **Throughput** field and update it's value to **400**.

    > This is the minimum throughput that you can allocate to a container.

1. Click the **Save** button at the top of the section to persist your new throughput allocation.

### Observing Throttling (HTTP 429)

1. Return to the currently open **Visual Studio Code** editor containing your .NET Core project.

1. Double-click the **Program.cs** link in the **Explorer** pane to open the file in the editor.

1. Locate the *using* block within the **Main** method and delete the code added for the previous section:

    ```csharp
    using (CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(_endpointUri, _primaryKey))
    {
        var database = client.GetDatabase(_databaseId);
        var peopleContainer = database.GetContainer(_peopleCollectionId);
        var transactionContainer = database.GetContainer(_transactionCollectionId);

    }
    ```

    > For the next few instructions, we will use the **Bogus** library to create test data. This library allows you to create a collection of objects with fake data set on each object's property. For this lab, our intent is to **focus on Azure Cosmos DB** instead of this library. With that intent in mind, the next set of instructions will expedite the process of creating test data.

1. Add the following code to create a collection of ``Transaction`` instances:

    ```csharp
    var transactions = new Bogus.Faker<Transaction>()
        .RuleFor(t => t.id, (fake) => Guid.NewGuid().ToString())
        .RuleFor(t => t.amount, (fake) => Math.Round(fake.Random.Double(5, 500), 2))
        .RuleFor(t => t.processed, (fake) => fake.Random.Bool(0.6f))
        .RuleFor(t => t.paidBy, (fake) => $"{fake.Name.FirstName().ToLower()}.{fake.Name.LastName().ToLower()}")
        .RuleFor(t => t.costCenter, (fake) => fake.Commerce.Department(1).ToLower())
        .GenerateLazy(100);
    ```

    > As a reminder, the Bogus library generates a set of test data. In this example, you are creating 100 items using the Bogus library and the rules listed above. The **GenerateLazy** method tells the Bogus library to prepare for a request of 100 items by returning a variable of type **IEnumerable<Transaction>**. Since LINQ uses deferred execution by default, the items aren't actually created until the collection is iterated.
    
1. Add the following foreach block to iterate over the ``Transaction`` instances:

    ```csharp
    foreach(var transaction in transactions)
    {
    }
    ```

1. Within the ``foreach`` block, add the following line of code to asynchronously create an item and save the result of the creation task to a variable:

    ```csharp
    ItemResponse<Transaction> result = await transactionContainer.CreateItemAsync(transaction);
    ```

    > The ``CreateItemAsync`` method of the ``CosmosContainer`` class takes in an object that you would like to serialize into JSON and store as an item within the specified collection.

1. Still within the ``foreach`` block, add the following line of code to write the value of the newly created resource's ``id`` property to the console:

    ```csharp
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Item Created\t{result.Resource.id}");
    ```

    > The ``ItemResponse`` type has a property named ``Resource`` that can give you access to the item instance resulting from the operation.

1. Your **Main** method should look like this:

    ```csharp
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {    
        using (CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(_endpointUri, _primaryKey))
        {
            var database = client.GetDatabase(_databaseId);
            var peopleContainer = database.GetContainer(_peopleCollectionId);
            var transactionContainer = database.GetContainer(_transactionCollectionId);
            var transactions = new Bogus.Faker<Transaction>()
                .RuleFor(t => t.id, (fake) => Guid.NewGuid().ToString())
                .RuleFor(t => t.amount, (fake) => Math.Round(fake.Random.Double(5, 500), 2))
                .RuleFor(t => t.processed, (fake) => fake.Random.Bool(0.6f))
                .RuleFor(t => t.paidBy, (fake) => $"{fake.Name.FirstName().ToLower()}.{fake.Name.LastName().ToLower()}")
                .RuleFor(t => t.costCenter, (fake) => fake.Commerce.Department(1).ToLower())
                .GenerateLazy(100);
            foreach (var transaction in transactions)
            {
                ItemResponse<Transaction> result = await transactionContainer.CreateItemAsync(transaction);
                await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Item Created\t{result.Resource.id}");
            }
        }
    }

## Setting Throughput for Expected Workloads

*Using appropriate RU settings for container or database throughput can allow you to meet desired performance at minimal cost. Deciding on a good baseline and varying settings based on expected usage patterns are both strategies that can help.*

### Estimating Throughput Needs

1. Locate the *using* block within the **Main** method:

    ```csharp
    using (CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(_endpointUri, _primaryKey))
    {
    }
    ```

1. Add the following code to use the **CreateItemAsync** method of the **CosmosContainer** class to add a new item and print out the value of the **RequestCharge** property of the **ItemResponse<>** instance:

    ```csharp
    ItemResponse<object> createResponse = await peopleContainer.CreateItemAsync(member);
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"{createResponse.RequestCharge} RUs");
    ```

1. Add the following lines of code to create variables to represent the estimated workload for our application:

    ```csharp
    int expectedWritesPerSec = 200;
    int expectedReadsPerSec = 800;
    ```

    > These types of numbers could come from planning a new application or tracking actual usage of an existing one. Details of determining workload are outside the scope of this lab.

1. Add the following line of code to print out the estimated throughput needs of our application based on our test queries:

    ```csharp
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Estimated load: {response.RequestCharge * expectedReadsPerSec + createResponse.RequestCharge * expectedWritesPerSec} RU per sec");
    ```

1. Save all of your open editor tabs.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Command Prompt** menu option.

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

    > This command will build and execute the console project.

1. Observe the output of the console application.

    > You should see the total throughput needed for our application based on our estimates, which can then be used to guide our provisioned throughput setting.

1. Click the **ðŸ—™** symbol to close the terminal pane.

### Adjusting for Usage Patterns

*Many applications have workloads that vary over time in a predictable way. For example, business applications that have a heavy workload during a 9-5 business day but minimal usage outside of those hours. Cosmos throughput settings can also be varied to match this type of usage pattern.*

1. Locate the *using* block within the **Main** method and delete the code added for the previous section:

    ```csharp
    using (CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(_endpointUri, _primaryKey))
    {
        var database = client.GetDatabase(_databaseId);
        var peopleContainer = database.GetContainer(_peopleCollectionId);
        var transactionContainer = database.GetContainer(_transactionCollectionId);
    }
    ```

1. Add the following code to retrieve the current RU/sec setting for the container:

    ```csharp
    int? current = await peopleContainer.ReadProvisionedThroughputAsync();
    ```

    > Note that the return type is a nullable value. Provisioned throughput can be set either at the container or database level. If set at the database level, this method on the **CosmosContainer** will return null. When set at the container level, the same method on **CosmosDatabase** will return null.

1. Add the following line of code to print out the provisioned throughput value:

    ```csharp
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"{current} RU per sec");
    ```

1. Add the following code to update the RU/sec setting for the container:

    ```csharp
    await peopleContainer.ReplaceProvisionedThroughputAsync(1000);
    ```

    > Although the overall minimum throughput that can be set is 400 RU/s, specific containers or databases may have higher limits depending on size of stored data, previous maximum throughput settings, or number of containers in a database. Trying to set a value below the available minimum will cause an exception here.

1. Save all of your open editor tabs.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Command Prompt** menu option.

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

    > This command will build and execute the console project.

1. Observe the output of the console application.

    > You should see the initial provisioned value before changing to **1000**.

1. Click the **ðŸ—™** symbol to close the terminal pane.

1. Return to the **Azure Portal** (<http://portal.azure.com>).

1. On the left side of the portal, click the **Resource groups** link.

1. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **cosmosgroup-lab** *Resource Group*.

1. In the **cosmosgroup-lab** blade, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you recently created.

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Data Explorer** link on the left side of the blade.

1. In the **Data Explorer** section, expand the **FinancialDatabase** database node, expand the **PeopleCollection** node, and then select the **Scale & Settings** option.

1. In the **Settings** section, locate the **Throughput** field and note that is is now set to **1000**.
